This repository will consist of projects I worked on from the beginning of my path in robotics, arduino, etc. This is where I started programming and did my first projects that shaped my interest in this career. The program codes uploaded here are inefficient, unoptimized and abandoned, but gave me all the learning I needed to move forward.

##### Arduino powered quadruple robot
The robot is powered with 12 SG90 servo motors, and the chassis was built with scrap acrylic. Raw servo angles were used without any math involved and no kinematics solvers were implemented. As a result, over performance was poor, but was a great place to start my future project.

##### Arduino powered obstacle avoidance tank
The robot was built on a tnak chassis, fit with two IR sensors and hence can avoid colliding into obstacle using these sensors. The Tank can also be controlled via a bluetooth app.

##### Ping Pong on arduino using 8x8 LED matrix
A simple game was programmed to get that good old retro feel of ping pong. An advanced version of this project is now being implemented on raspberry pi with a bigger, better and more colorful LED matrix.
